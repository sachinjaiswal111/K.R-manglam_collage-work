OS LAB ASSIGNMENT 2 REPORT
============================
Student: Bhumitanwar
Date: Tuesday 30 September 2025 12:45:23 AM IST

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
======================

1. SYSTEM STARTUP SIMULATION:
   - Simulated boot sequence with kernel initialization
   - Filesystem mounting and service startup
   - Sequential startup messages

2. PROCESS CREATION:
   - Used multiprocessing module for concurrent execution
   - Created 3 different processes with unique tasks:
     * Process-1: CPU-intensive calculations
     * Process-2: I/O operations simulation  
     * Process-3: System service simulation

3. LOGGING SYSTEM:
   - Implemented using Python logging module
   - Timestamped entries with process names
   - Logs stored in 'process_log.txt'
   - Tracks process lifecycle (start → execution → end)

4. PROCESS TERMINATION:
   - Proper joining of all processes
   - System shutdown sequence simulation
   - Clean termination with status messages

CODE STRUCTURE:
===============
- system_startup(): Simulates boot sequence
- system_process(): Individual process task
- system_shutdown(): Simulates shutdown
- main(): Orchestrates entire simulation

OUTPUT VERIFICATION:
====================
- Terminal displays real-time system messages
- Log file contains detailed timestamped records
- All processes start and end properly
- System startup and shutdown sequences complete

CONCLUSION:
===========
Successfully simulated OS system behavior including startup, 
process management, and shutdown using Python multiprocessing 
and logging modules.
